# ⚠️ APP NOT READY
- This release is here for dev testing - I'm working on it
- Auto updater is ready - that means you can download build, and in some time it will automatically become usable app

# 🎯 Changes for v0.1
- Go from architecture armv7 to arm64, because of libraries problems - use 64-bit RPi OS

# 🐛 Bugfixes in this release
- Show proper update status instead of "Checking..." all time
